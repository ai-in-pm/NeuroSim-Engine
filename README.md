## Overview

The NeuroSim Engine simulates a virtual brain that behaves like an autistic LLM with anatomical fidelity and PTSD overlays. It models neurocognitive interactions between individuals with autism and PTSD, incorporating multi-modal sensory processing, brain region activation patterns, and trauma-related responses.

## Features

### üß† Core Neural Simulation
- **Token-to-Brain Region Routing**: Maps LLM token activations to anatomically-inspired brain regions
- **Microcircuit Simulation**: Models GABA/Glutamate dynamics with E/I ratio imbalances
- **Multi-Modal Fusion**: Integrates visual, auditory, vestibular, and interoceptive embeddings
- **Memory Systems**: Episodic memory formation, consolidation, and retrieval
- **Flashback Engine**: PTSD-specific trauma reactivation and memory intrusion

### üéØ Autism-Specific Modeling
- Enhanced sensory hypersensitivity
- Altered social processing and eye contact difficulties
- Cognitive rigidity and executive function differences
- Detail-focused processing with reduced gist extraction
- Sensory overload and stimming behaviors

### ‚ö° PTSD-Specific Modeling
- Hypervigilance and threat detection
- Trauma-encoded memory patterns
- Flashback triggers and dissociation
- Combat-specific triggers (Operation Phantom Fury context)
- Delayed inhibition and memory flooding

## Quick Start

### Building the Engine

```bash
# Create build directory
mkdir build && cd build

# Configure with CMake
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release

# Build the engine
make -j4

# Run tests
./neurosim_test
```

### Python Interface

```python
from NeuroSimEngine.pybind.loader import create_combined_simulation

# Create a combined autism + PTSD simulation
engine = create_combined_simulation()

# Add trauma memory
engine.add_trauma_memory("Combat explosions", sensitivity=0.7)

# Process text input
result = engine.process_text("Loud explosion nearby")

print(f"Response: {result['response_text']}")
print(f"Flashback: {result['flashback_triggered']}")
print(f"Amygdala activation: {result['region_activations']['Amygdala']}")
```

### Multi-Modal Processing

```python
import numpy as np

# Create multi-modal input
visual_data = np.random.randn(512) * 0.8    # Visual embedding
audio_data = np.random.randn(256) * 1.2     # Audio embedding
motion_data = {"embedding": np.random.randn(128) * 0.4}
body_state = {"embedding": np.random.randn(64) * 0.9}

# Process multi-modal input
result = engine.process_multimodal(
    text="Crowded noisy environment",
    visual_data=visual_data,
    audio_data=audio_data,
    motion_data=motion_data,
    body_state=body_state
)
```

NeuroSimulator::Config config;
config.autism_mode = true;
config.excitation_ratio = 1.4;  // Elevated E/I ratio
config.inhibition_delay = 0.0;   // Normal inhibition timing
```

### PTSD Mode
```cpp
config.ptsd_overlay = true;
config.inhibition_delay = 50.0;      // Delayed inhibition
config.flashback_sensitivity = 0.5;  // Flashback trigger sensitivity
```

### Combat PTSD (Operation Phantom Fury)
```cpp
config.ptsd_overlay = true;
config.inhibition_delay = 60.0;      // Longer delay for combat PTSD
config.flashback_sensitivity = 0.4;  // Higher sensitivity
// Includes Fallujah-specific trauma templates
```

## Testing & Validation

## Limitations & Important Warnings

### Technical Limitations:
- This is a simulation engine for research purposes, **NOT a diagnostic or medical tool**
- Brain region mappings are simplified computational representations
- Neurotransmitter dynamics are mathematical approximations
- Neural circuits are modeled, not actual biological processes
- Clinical applications require extensive validation with real-world data

- **NOT CLINICALLY VALIDATED**: Results have not been validated against clinical standards
- **NO THERAPEUTIC VALUE**: This tool provides no therapeutic benefit
- **POTENTIAL FOR MISINTERPRETATION**: Simulation results may be misinterpreted as medical information
- **NOT FOR VULNERABLE POPULATIONS**: Should not be used with individuals in crisis or vulnerable states

### Ethical Considerations:
- Autism and PTSD are serious conditions requiring professional medical care
- This simulation may not accurately represent individual experiences
- Results should never influence medical or therapeutic decisions
- Respect the dignity and complexity of neurodivergent individuals
- Combat trauma and PTSD require specialized professional treatment
